        <h3><strong>About</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            Cryptui combines the worlds of crypto and web3, drawing inspiration from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0K1q9JriDE">Tui bird</a>, a beautiful native species of New Zealand.<br>
            The logo is based on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram">tangram</a>, a traditional Chinese puzzle that represents the versatility and adaptability of our approach.<br><br>
            In my professional career, I have gained extensive experience in various engineering functions and have a proven record of success<br>

            focusing on blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies since 2017. Over the past five years, I have actively tracked and traded various<br>
            ICOs, IDOs, DeFi, NFTs, and WEB3 projects. I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest trends and continuously expanding<br>
            my knowledge through ongoing education and training. I am passionate about the potential for blockchain technology to revolutionize<br>
            the world, and I am proud to be a part of the crypto community. As a crypto trader and advocate, I am dedicated to using my expertise<br>
