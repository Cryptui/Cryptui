Hi, I'm Cryptui! I'm spreading my wings into the digital world of web3, AI, and Blockchain. The name Cryptui combines the world of crypto with the [Tui bird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0K1q9JriDE), a beautiful native species of New Zealand. The logo is based on a [tangram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram), a traditional Chinese puzzle that represents the flexibility and adaptability of my approach.
